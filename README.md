# A LaTex beamer template

This template constitutes a LaTex environment for creating presentations that align with the University of Stuttgart's corporate design. In particular, the template is adapted to presentations given by or hold at the [Department of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/lww/).

* Put figures in the `fig` folder
* Put videos in the `videos` folder
* Modify or change logos in the `theme/logos` folder

Basic styles are defined with inline comments in `beamerthemelww.sty` and the `main.tex` latex files.

**For compiling slides, I recommend to use**

* LuaLaTex compiler
* [TEXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/#download) - use `main.txss` to load the repository as a session

The repository is private because of unlcear licenses of Uni Stuttgart logo reuse.
